# FourierModalMethod-PyTorch
This repository provides a PyTorch-based implementation of the Fourier Modal Method (FMM) for nanophotonic structures. It is inspired by and adapted from the original MATLABÂ® codes presented in the book:  > **_Fourier Modal Method and Its Applications in Computational Nanophotonics_**
